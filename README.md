# odin-recipes

## Motivation

I'm taking part in The Odin Project. I started learning HTML and full-stack development a few years ago. Due to university, AI, and some unplanned events, I lost focus on web development and decided to brush up on my knowledge with this course.

## Project Scope

As the name suggests, this project has something to do with recipes. I will create a simple recipe site using pure HTML. It might look ugly at first, but I have to start somewhere on my full-stack development journey.

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A rich, velvety tomato soup that brings together the bold sweetness of ripe tomatoes, a hint of garlic, and the subtle depth of herbs. This comforting classic is slow-simmered to intensify flavor and blended to silky perfection. Whether served with a grilled cheese sandwich or a swirl of cream and basil, it’s a soul-warming bowl of pure simplicity — made for cozy nights or light lunches alike.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds fresh tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium yellow or white onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Prep the vegetables: Wash and chop the tomatoes. Peel and finely chop the garlic and onion.</li>
        <li>Sauté aromatics: In a large pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic. Cook until soft and translucent, about 5–7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Make the roux: Stir in the flour and cook for 1–2 minutes, stirring constantly, until a paste forms.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes to the pot. Stir well and cook for another 5 minutes to let the flavors blend.</li>
        <li>Pour in broth: Add the chicken broth, stir to combine, and bring everything to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer for 20–25 minutes, until tomatoes are fully softened.</li>
        <li>Blend the soup: Use an immersion blender directly in the pot, or transfer the soup in batches to a countertop blender. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Season: Stir in sugar and salt. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve hot: Pour into bowls and serve as-is, or garnish with cream, basil, or croutons.</li>
    </ol>
